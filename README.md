# About the Project
This project is a machine learning project based on the binary classifcation of light curves from the Kepler telescope. The Kepler telescope ran from 2009 to 2018 and its main goal was to find Earth-sized exoplanets. It collected the brightness of ~150,000 stars over its time in service and from the change in brightness of a star, NASA was able to determine if a star had an exoplanet in its system. I used the NASA Exoplanet Archive to download light curves generated by the Kepler telescope to train 6 different algorithms to try and determine if a light curve was indicative of an exoplanet: KNN, Naive Bayes, LSTM, MLP, GRU, and CNN.
